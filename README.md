# National-Parks

//project description/Let people know what your project can do specifically.

This project seeks to offer information on the [US National Parks](https://www.nps.gov/index.htm), with features to add parks to a user's bucket list, create a user specified trips log to plan our visiting National Parks.

// Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here.

Using an API found [here](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm#/), the team built functionality to store user-selected park data from the NPS API into a user-dedicated bucketlist and trip SQL tables. PostgresSQL functionality was achieved via [Elephant SQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/)].

//Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video

//Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things...

This project was developed with Javascript and React with Hooks. The package.json contains npm installation of CORS, Express, Axios, Nodemon, pgAdmin for the postgresSQL, webpack, and a statename to abbreviation conversion tool. Other package details are related to style, proxy server, and various webpack loaders.

//If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
Future releases will include: - An interactive map pinpointing the location of the Parks - Park data cross-referenced with animals, and flora and fauna of the US - Weather reports feature - Trip planner with Google Maps - User forum
